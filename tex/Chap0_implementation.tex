% For example, in a 5x5 Gaussian blur, five line buffers would each store a row of the image, allowing the FPGA to access a 5x5 block of pixels concurrently. These line buffers are implemented using shift registers, often made up of Flip-Flops or dedicated Block RAMs, and are clocked synchronously. As new pixel rows from the image stream in, the line buffers shift their content, dropping the oldest row and appending the newest one at the end.
