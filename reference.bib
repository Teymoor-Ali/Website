abstract = {Image processing pipelines combine the challenges of stencil computations and stream programs. They are composed of large graphs of different stencil stages, as well as complex reductions, and stages with global or data-dependent access patterns. Because of their complex structure, the performance difference between a naive implementation of a pipeline and an optimized one is often an order of magnitude. Efficient implementations require optimization of both parallelism and locality, but due to the nature of stencils, there is a fundamental tension between parallelism, locality, and introducing redundant recomputation of shared values.We present a systematic model of the tradeoff space fundamental to stencil pipelines, a schedule representation which describes concrete points in this space for each stage in an image processing pipeline, and an optimizing compiler for the Halide image processing language that synthesizes high performance implementations from a Halide algorithm and a schedule. Combining this compiler with stochastic search over the space of schedules enables terse, composable programs to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of real image processing pipelines, and across different hardware architectures, including multicores with SIMD, and heterogeneous {CPU}+{GPU} execution. From simple Halide programs written in a few hours, we demonstrate performance up to 5x faster than hand-tuned C, intrinsics, and CUDA implementations optimized by experts over weeks or months, for image processing applications beyond the reach of past automatic compilers.},

A specific memory management unit has been defined to adjust the number of acquisitions to improve HDR quality. This smart camera is built around a standard B\&W CMOS image sensor and a Xilinx {FPGA}. It embeds multiple captures, HDR processing, data display and transfer, which is an original contribution compared to the state-of-the-art. The proposed architecture enables a real-time HDR video flow for a full sensor resolution (1.3 Mega pixels) at 60 frames per second.}

	abstract     = {Modern field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips, with their larger memory capacity and reconfigurability potential, are opening new frontiers in rapid prototyping of embedded systems. With the advent of high-density FPGAs, it is now possible to implement a high-performance VLIW (very long instruction word) processor core in an FPGA. With VLIW architecture, the processor effectiveness depends on the ability of compilers to provide sufficient ILP (instruction-level parallelism) from program code. This paper describes research result about enabling the VLIW processor model for real-time processing applications by exploiting FPGA technology. Our goals are to keep the flexibility of processors to shorten the development cycle, and to use the powerful FPGA resources to increase real-time performance. We present a flexible VLIW VHDL processor model with a variable instruction set and a customizable architecture which allows exploiting intrinsic parallelism of a target application using advanced compiler technology and implementing it in an optimal manner on FPGA. Some common algorithms of image processing were tested and validated using the proposed development cycle. We also realized the rapid prototyping of embedded contactless palmprint extraction on an FPGA Virtex-6 based board for a biometric application and obtained a processing time of 145.6 ms per image. Our approach applies some criteria for co-design tools: flexibility, modularity, performance, and reusability.}

The toolflow is built around a compiler that converts C into a functional dataflow intermediate representation, exposing instruction-level, pipeline and memory parallelism. The compiler performs optimizations and converts the intermediate representation into pipelined asynchronous circuits, with no centralized controllers. In the resulting circuits, control is distributed, communication is achieved through local wires, and arbitration for datapath resources is unnecessary. Circuits automatically synthesized from Mediabench kernels exhibit substantially better energy-delay than either single-issue processors or aggressive superscalar cores.},

A specific memory management unit has been defined to adjust the number of acquisitions to improve HDR quality. This smart camera is built around a standard B\&W CMOS image sensor and a Xilinx FPGA. It embeds multiple captures, HDR processing, data display and transfer, which is an original contribution compared to the state-of-the-art. The proposed architecture enables a real-time HDR video flow for a full sensor resolution (1.3 Mega pixels) at 60 frames per second.}

	abstract     = {Modern field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips, with their larger memory capacity and reconfigurability potential, are opening new frontiers in rapid prototyping of embedded systems. With the advent of high-density {FPGAs}, it is now possible to implement a high-performance VLIW (very long instruction word) processor core in an FPGA. With VLIW architecture, the processor effectiveness depends on the ability of compilers to provide sufficient ILP (instruction-level parallelism) from program code. This paper describes research result about enabling the VLIW processor model for real-time processing applications by exploiting FPGA technology. Our goals are to keep the flexibility of processors to shorten the development cycle, and to use the powerful FPGA resources to increase real-time performance. We present a flexible VLIW VHDL processor model with a variable instruction set and a customizable architecture which allows exploiting intrinsic parallelism of a target application using advanced compiler technology and implementing it in an optimal manner on FPGA. Some common algorithms of image processing were tested and validated using the proposed development cycle. We also realized the rapid prototyping of embedded contactless palmprint extraction on an FPGA Virtex-6 based board for a biometric application and obtained a processing time of 145.6 ms per image. Our approach applies some criteria for co-design tools: flexibility, modularity, performance, and reusability.}

The toolflow is built around a compiler that converts C into a functional dataflow intermediate representation, exposing instruction-level, pipeline and memory parallelism. The compiler performs optimizations and converts the intermediate representation into pipelined asynchronous circuits, with no centralized controllers. In the resulting circuits, control is distributed, communication is achieved through local wires, and arbitration for datapath resources is unnecessary. Circuits automatically synthesized from Mediabench kernels exhibit substantially better energy-delay than either single-issue processors or aggressive superscalar cores.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce Chisel, a new hardware construction language that supports advanced hardware design using highly parameterized generators and layered domain-specific hardware languages. By embedding Chisel in the Scala programming language, we raise the level of hardware design abstraction by providing concepts including object orientation, functional programming, parameterized types, and type inference. Chisel can generate a high-speed C++-based cycle-accurate software simulator, or low-level Verilog designed to map to either FPGAs or to a standard ASIC flow for synthesis. This paper presents Chisel, its embedding in Scala, hardware examples, and results for C++ simulation, Verilog emulation and ASIC synthesis.},

abstract = {Recent work on Winograd-based convolution allows for a great reduction of computational complexity, but existing implementations are limited to 2D data and a single kernel size of 3 by 3. They can achieve only slightly better, and often worse performance than better optimized, direct convolution implementations. We propose and implement an algorithm for N-dimensional Winograd-based convolution that allows arbitrary kernel sizes and is optimized for manycore CPUs. Our algorithm achieves high hardware utilization through a series of optimizations. Our experiments show that on modern ConvNets, our optimized implementation, is on average more than 3 x, and sometimes 8 x faster than other state-of-the-art CPU implementations on an Intel Xeon Phi manycore processors. Moreover, our implementation on the Xeon Phi achieves competitive performance for 2D ConvNets and superior performance for 3D ConvNets, compared with the best GPU implementations.},
